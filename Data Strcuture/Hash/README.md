# Hash Algorithms

Hash algorithms are essential in computer science for mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. They are widely used in data structures like hash tables to efficiently store and retrieve data.

## Characteristics

- **Deterministic**: For a given input, a hash function will always produce the same output.
- **Fixed Output Size**: The output size of a hash function is fixed, regardless of the input size.
- **Efficient**: Hash functions should be computationally efficient to calculate.
- **Uniformity**: Hash functions should evenly distribute hash values across the output range.

## Hash Tables

- **Associative Arrays**: Data structures that map keys to values.
- **Collision Resolution**: Techniques for handling cases where different keys hash to the same value.
  - Separate Chaining
  - Open Addressing (Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Double Hashing)
- **Load Factor**: The ratio of the number of stored elements to the size of the table.
- **Performance**: Hash tables offer constant-time average-case performance for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Applications

Hash algorithms find applications in various areas, including:

- **Databases**: Indexing and searching records efficiently.
- **Cryptography**: Generating cryptographic hashes for data integrity verification.
- **Checksums**: Verifying the integrity of data transmitted over networks.
- **Password Hashing**: Storing passwords securely by hashing them before storage.
- **Data Deduplication**: Identifying and eliminating duplicate data in storage systems.
